# 1d Convolutional Neural Network with Human Activity Recognition

This is atutorial from https://machinelearningmastery.com/cnn-models-for-human-activity-recognition-time-series-classification/ that applies CNN's (1d CNN's to be more exact) for solving human activity recognition problems (tracked analised data from gyroscope and accelerometer movements taken with the phone.

This repository is my implementation of that tutorial, to succesfully implement it and understand the concepts and functionality.
